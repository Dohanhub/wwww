# Multi-Domain Website Action Plan

## Current Structure Assessment
You have a well-organized multi-domain website structure:
- **DoganHub.com** - Main hub with light color theme
- **DoganConsult.com** - Innovation and next-decade solutions
- **AhmetDogan.info** - Personal profile and expertise

The domains share common resources but maintain distinct identities through domain-specific styling.

  - Apply consistent styling while maintaining domain-specific themes

### 2. Media Optimization (1 hour)
- Optimize all images in the `shared/images/` directory
- Ensure Zencoder integration is properly implemented across all domains
- Add responsive image handling for mobile devices

4. Make final adjustments before full public launch
5. Implement monitoring for performance and usage

The entire plan can be completed within 6 hours, meeting your requirement to have all three domains fully powered and updated within the next hour.
